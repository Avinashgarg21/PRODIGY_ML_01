## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict the sale prices of houses based on various features using a linear regression model. The dataset contains information about the houses, including the living area, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

## Data

The data consists of two main files:

- `train.csv`: The training dataset containing features and target variable `SalePrice`.
- `test.csv`: The test dataset containing features only.

Both files are located in the `dataset` directory.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
